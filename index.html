      <p>At a time where the world was just made of dirt and water. Gods, who didn’t know what to do with this world, created a civilization called “Ancestors”. A race of people that we cannot describe physically. Due to the fact they disappeared. </p>

<p>But before that, they created things for the land where they lived. Bringing animals, plants and every natural thing that stands in the Shattered Realms. To do that, Gods gave them full control over a power we today call “Magic”. Ancestors' mastery over it was great, and way better than the one we have in our times. Unfortunately… Power can change people’s mind. And a Ancestor, called “The Hungry One” wanted more and more power. </p>

<p>When the rest of his kind was powerful enough to be seen as demi-gods. He wanted to become a god, and for that he started to learn about Magic more and more. Until one day, his kind discovered it. And they fought him, even if The Hungry One was stronger than the rest of his race. The combined force of the others contained him. But in a battle, that also was the last one, The Hungry One used so much magic that he killed his entire kind and himself… 
What happened next was simple, Magic spread around the World that was not called Shattered Realms at that time. And these magic movements became something we call Winds of Magic. And those Winds of Magic were able, sometimes and rarely, to create gigantic portals. Those took the name of Worlds Opening. That appears randomly and opens the doorway to different dimensions. Allowing things and sometimes entire cities to teleport in the Shattered Realms. And that’s why it took this name. After some years, new races arrived in the Shattered Realms. The first one were Goblins and Orcs, followed by Humans, undeads of all kinds and Elves. To finally be joined by Dwarves and Ogres. All of them created places to live. From small camps to majestic underground cities.</p>

<p>And now, a new World Opening occurred… Allowing new factions and culture to join this broken world. So only time will tell us what will happen next….</p>
